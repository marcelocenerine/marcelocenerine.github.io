Hey, welcome to my blog! 

I'm a software developer currently coding at Workday, Ireland. On my free time (guess what?) I write my own pet projects 
as well as contributions to open source projects on GitHub.

I have been a Java developer for the most part of my career. Not long ago I got introduced to the Scala language 
and (oh boy) that was love at first sight.

My current topics of interest are programming languages (Scala, Java and maybe Haskell at some point in the future), 
containers (Docker and Kubernetes), algorithms and software development in general. Those are the topics that you will 
likely find on this blog. Please check it out and don't forget to leave a comment if you find something helpful.
