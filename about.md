Hey, welcome to my blog!

I'm a software developer currently living in Dublin, Ireland.

I have been a Java developer for the most part of my career. A few years ago I got introduced to the Scala language and (oh boy) that was love at first sight.

My topics of interest are programming languages, container technologies, distributed systems and algorithms. Those are the stuff you will most likely find on this blog. Please check it out and don't forget to leave a comment if you find something helpful.
